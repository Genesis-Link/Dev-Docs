# Empowering Gamers

The games we play shouldn't be limited to the latest releases of big AAA studios, but rather the most popular and fun games of the present day. Let gamers decide the game which deserves the spotlight. When a particular game has proven itself and checked all of the gamer’s boxes, don’t stop with a one-and-done release. Enable the community a choice in what happens next. Should the makers keep improving the current experience, should they add a completely new feature, or Maybe they should start a fresh new experience? 
Not all games will prove themselves worthy, however, this is what will make or break the success of their makers.
Whatever the given circumstance, no single money-hungry AAA studio should be calling all the shots. Community input should not be a simple blow in the wind. In the end, games are works of passion and need to be treated as so, not just by the people keeping the wheels turning, but also by those who enjoy them.
